        <section class="about-me">
            <p>I am passionate about climate, the environment, and the economic transition needed to mitigate the worst
                of
                the
                climate crisis. I am also deeply interested in extreme weather: no matter what we do in the future, we
                have
                done
                so much damage to the environment already that we must learn how to live with the increasingly common
                occurrence
                of severe weather and storms.</p>
            <p>I created the website <a href="https://crowdedparks.org" target="_blank">CrowdedParks.org</a> to report
                on
                national parks and climate, aiming to raise awareness about environmental issues. I also covered COP28
                on my
                substack, <a href="https://sparksonclimate.substack.com/" target="_blank">Sparks On Climate</a>. I am a
                current
                board member at the North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS). I live in the NYC area with
                my
                family
                and am a five-time IRONMAN finisher (2.4mi swim, 112 mi bike, 26.2 mi run).</p>

            <h2>Career Transition</h2>
            <p>After completing my undergraduate studies at Yale University, I spent a decade gaining valuable tech
                experience
                at renowned companies like The New York Times and Life360. While I enjoyed working in the tech industry,
                I
                felt
                a compelling desire to transition my career towards addressing the pressing issues surrounding the climate crisis â€“ undoubtedly the most important story of our lifetimes.</p>
            <p>My career change is fueled by a deep passion for environmental advocacy. Changing careers is a big
                undertaking, but my main strength is my unique ability to tackle
                seemingly insurmountable challenges by breaking them down into manageable tasks, and tackling them
                one-by-one, without getting distracted and no matter how difficult. This approach has been
                instrumental in my previous endeavors, including the creation of CrowdedParks.org, a platform dedicated
                to
                reporting on national parks and climate issues.</p>
            <p>In pursuit of furthering my expertise, I pursued a Master's degree in Digital Mapping from the University
                of
                Kentucky, enhancing my skills and knowledge in areas crucial to addressing environmental challenges.</p>

            <h2>Seeking a Role</h2>
            <p>I am actively seeking a role where I can leverage my expertise in cartography, technology, and writing to
                amplify
                crucial climate narratives and catalyze meaningful positive change. My ultimate goal is to utilize my
                skills
                and
                passion to contribute towards a sustainable future, prioritizing the well-being of people over profit
                margins.
